                    Hello there! My name is Matthew Braun. I am a Software Engineer located in
                    Anaheim, CA who loves coding, loves food, and hates spiders.
                    I will be graduating in May 2020 with two Bachelor's Degree's - one in Computer Science and
                    the other in Mathematics. I am passionate about writing programs and using
                    algorithms to solve complex problems, and I am fueled by my desire to build
                    production-quality tools and applications that can impact those around me.

                <p id="about-text-two" class="about-text line about-two">
                    I strongly believe that being well-rounded at work and in life is the key to 
                    being successful. When developing, I spend an extensive amount of time learning 
                    new tools, languages, and algorithms. When not developing, I enjoy spending 
                    time with my friends, going to the gym, playing video games, and performing.
                    My favorite instrument is the piano.

                    I am currently working as a part-time Software Engineer for Cisco, where I work under a
                    machine learning engineering team within Cisco's customer experience organization
                    in order to develop frameworks and platforms which empower other engineers, data 
                    scientist, and analysts on my team. While here, I have worked extensively gaining
                    experience in both DevOps and MLOps as well as in Software Engineering and Data

                            my team in developing and deploying ML Models. Most of my work was done using Python and Terraform,
                            but I also utilized custom bash scripts in order to customize certain deployments as needed.

                        advances with the lead Software Engineer on our team helped me learn a lot more about the business side of
                        Software Engineering, especially since I had never been exposed to that before.

                        <br/>
                        First, performing at its core is structured communication. In the workforce, a major expectation for
                        engineers is to be able to communicate clearly with other people within the team on projects and to also
                        communicate with managers, stakeholders, and other teams on development ideas, needs, blocks.
                        <br/>
                        Second, performing is an outlet which helps balance out my professional and personal life, ultimately making me
                        better at both.
